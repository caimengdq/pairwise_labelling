# pairwise_labelling
This labelling tool leverages an active sampling algorithm for pairwise image comparisonâ€”a technique proven crucial for tasks where traditional pairwise comparison protocols demand extensive comparisons, often impractical due to time or resource constraints. Drawing inspiration from the research paper: [Active Sampling for Pairwise Comparisons via Approximate Message Passing and Information Gain Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05691) ,  this implementation significantly streamlines the labelling process, minimizing the number of comparisons required to derive accurate rankings across all samples.
